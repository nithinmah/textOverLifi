# *Demonstrate Li-fi communication by transmitting and receiving text messages*
- Raspberry Pi takes text message input from user and transmits it over light.
- Arduino hosts a solar cell that receives the light and decodes the message sent from the Pi.
- Ascii coding is used for transmission, with a 20 bit preamble for synchronization.
